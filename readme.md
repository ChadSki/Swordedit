# Swordedit

Originally developed by Grenadiac in C++ for Windows, Sparkedit's source was given to bobindashadows,
who began porting the application to OS X. He handed the project off to Sword, who released the project
under its new name 'Swordedit'. Since then, Samuco has taken up the reins and continued adding features.
