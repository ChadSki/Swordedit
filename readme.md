# Swordedit

Originally developed by Grenadiac in C++ for Windows, Sparkedit's source was given to bobindashadows, who began porting the application to OS X under the new name 'Swordedit'. Since then, the code has changed hands several times but has always remained GPL-licensed. The most recent maintainer of the project is Samuco of MacGamingMods.

### License

Swordedit is licensed under the GPLv2 or, at your option, any later version.
